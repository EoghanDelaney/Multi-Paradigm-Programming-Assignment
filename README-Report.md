## Project Introduction

The aim of this project was to code a Shop, where customers can buy a number of products, in three different programming languages - C, Java and Python. The project called for two different programming paradigms, Object Orientated Programming for the Java language attempt and Procedural Programming for both the C and Python. The output from all three were to be indistinguishable from one another, to the end user.

The intended outcome of the project was to get a better understanding of the differences between the two different approaches while simultaneously learning about the three different programming languages.

The project task was to build aditional functionality into a base code for each language - C, Pytohn and Java. *(Below is an extract from the assessment paper)*.

    - The shop CSV should hold the initial cash value for the shop.
    
    - Read in customer orders from a CSV file.
        - That file should include all the products they wish to buy and in what quantity
        - It should also include their name and their budget.

    - The shop must be able to process the orders of the customer.
        - Update the cash in the shop based on money received.
            - It is important that the state of the shop be consistent.
            - You should create customer test files (CSVs) which cannot be completed by the shop e.g. customer wants 400 loaves of bread but the shop only has 20, or the customer wants 2 cans of coke but can only afford 1.
            - If these files donâ€™t exist marks penalties will be applied.
        - Know whether or not the shop can fill an order.
            - Thrown an appropriate error.

    - Operate in a live mode, where the user can enter a product by name, specify a quantity, and pay for it. The user should be able to buy many products in this way.
